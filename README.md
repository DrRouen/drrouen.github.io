## About Hippocampus Project

The hippocampus is part of the mammalian brain and belongs to the limbic system, which is important in spatial memory and navigation and helps turn short-term memory into long-term memory.

This project aims to archive some censored information and articles in the Chinese Innernet, especially those that vanished during COVID-19. We are here because we don't want the truth to be forgotten, and to enlighten future generations.
